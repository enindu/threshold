# Threshold

Threshold is a simple application based on [systemd](https://github.com/systemd/systemd) that automatically brings down a network interface after a specified amount of data has passed through it. Internally, it reads from the `/proc/net/dev` file to monitor network usage and uses the [netlink](https://github.com/vishvananda/netlink) package to manage network interfaces.

## Install

Since this application requires root privileges, youâ€™ll need to install Threshold as the root user and configure the environment accordingly. Assuming you are already logged in as root, add the following lines to the `/root/.bash_profile` file:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.go/bin"
export GOPATH="$HOME/.go"
```

After updating the file, apply the changes by running:

```
source /root/.bash_profile
```

You can now install Threshold using the `go install` command:

```
go install github.com/enindu/threshold@latest
```

## Usage

Here is how to use Threshold:

```
threshold <command>:<subcommand> [arguments]
```

For example, to start the daemon, run:

```
threshold daemon:start eth0 1024 1
```

To view a list of available commands:

```
threshold help
```

To see the subcommands for a specific command:

```
threshold <command>:help
```

For instance, to view help for the `daemon` command:

```
threshold daemon:help
```
